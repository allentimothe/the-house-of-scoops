            Welcome to the house of scoops. We are an artisan, small batch, unique, house-made ice cream shop. We have always had a love for desserts and decided to bring our love to life, with the opening our first location, in Glendora CA.
            <br />
            <br />
            Like many of us, we found ourselves with a little extra time during the pandemic and decided to move forward with our dream of opening our own ice cream shop.
            <br />
            <br />
            All of our ice cream is built on our love for desserts and the creative process of blending unique flavors into high quality ice cream and sorbets.
            <br />
            <br />
            We know you will love our ice creams as much as we love making them.
            <br />
